Another definition is \"low quality news with intentionally false information\" [[1]](#def). Fake news can be spread easily across social media because of their low production cost that contribute to profitability, and the format of the news which is small pieces of information [[2]](#spread). Moreover, bots are being employed on social media and have a great impact on spearding fake news since they play an important role in amplifying fake news in the very early moments of a post, and they also target influential users using replies and mentions [[3]](#bots). This strategy is often used by groups of interest in order to affect a country's election [[4]](#beliefs). It can also be utilized by other groups or individuals in the business section in order to affect the reputation of others [[4]](#beliefs). Finally, everyone can post, reply and share on social media and combined with the idea that \"everyone now has their own truth, which is based on their personal knowledge and experience and not much else\" [[4]](#beliefs) it is another reason for the wide spread of fake news across social media. \n"],"metadata":{"id":"I6iYHdxRCEB1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data Exhibition\n","\n","`spark_df.show(10)`:\n","<br>\n","<center><img src= \"http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1lm_c40U92urrQ4lOmqHwlThLNG8CmYNH\" width=\"70%\" />\n","<br>\n","<b><u> Fig 2.</b></u>: Target Column Distribution </center>\n","\n","In the figure above, both the text and the author are truncated since they are much larger than the dimensions of the output. \n","\n","### Attributes:\n","There are 3 attributes in this dataset:\n","\n","1. ***Title*** - The title of the particular news\n","1. ***Text*** - The news\n","1. ***Author*** - The author of the particular news.
